			%p The Mueller Megawatt Project was started in the middle of 2009 to loosely organize a grassroots effort to go solar in the <a href="http://www.MuellerAustin.com/" target="_blank">Mueller Community</a> in Austin, TX. The ultimate goal of the group was to see one Megawatt (1,000 kilowatts) of solar capacity installed in the Mueller neighborhood. After the group's namesake was achieved in the summer of 2011, solar capacity has continued to grow in the neighborhood.
