					%p We are organizing a group solar purchase program to help meet recent demand. The MMP helps reduce prices by streamlining the process between Homeowners, Solar Installers, the POA and Austin Energy. Additionally, MMP members focus on education to help prospective buyers determine if going solar is right for them. If you are interested in joining the over 225 homes in Mueller with solar, follow check out the "How It Works" section to learn about next steps.

					%td.comment-icon Attend a MMP Happy Hour
					%td You'll learn everything you need to know about solar. We'll tell you what happens to solar panels when scenes from "Twister" unfold and walk you through how the technology works.

				%tr 
					%td 2. 
					%td.search-icon Decide on 3 Solar Installers
					%td Check out the Participating Solar Installers page to learn about the 5 solar installers participating in Mueller Solar 2015. Read their information, check out their website, ask your friends, and pick 3 installers to get bids from. Once you decide, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1n7NWfjT9ui-PFHb8mGR32kiisOMHWL03rGwC7Fc6Ar8/viewform?usp=send_form" target="_blank">please submit this form.</a> 
				%tr
					%td 3. 
					%td.timer-icon Wait Patiently
					%td MMP will pass your contact information to the installers you selected. The installers will only contact you to let you know when they will be evaluating your roof. You do not need to be home for this. Once they do their evaluation, they will email you a proposal with a design & pricing. Yay!
				%tr
					%td 4. 
					%td.roi-icon Figure out your ROI
					%td	<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1n7NWfjT9ui-PFHb8mGR32kiisOMHWL03rGwC7Fc6Ar8/viewform?usp=send_form" target="_blank">Download This</a> spreadsheet to determine your Return on Investment. Enter in your average monthly solar consumption on the 1st tab and the sheet will estimate your ROI. You can update the sheet with your pricing once you get bids to get a more accurate estimate.

				%tr 
					%td 5.
					%td.ok-icon Select a Proposal
					%td Once you receive all three proposals, you will need to select one. We highly recommend that you ask us questions - we will make ourselves available over beers (that you pay for) at HEB, Torchys and on the Street (not a new restaurant, just the actual street) 
				%tr
					%td 6.
					%td.write-icon Fill Out Paperwork
					%td At this point, you'll need to (a) sign a contract with the installer, (b) submit a Letter of Intent (LOI) to Austin Energy and (c) submit a request to the POA Modification Committee to approve your install.
				%tr 
					%td 7. 
					%td.sun-icon Go Solar!
					%td The solar installer you selected will schedule the installation of your system within a couple weeks. This process is pretty painless since they don't need access to the inside of your home.

							%td.comment-icon Why Us
							%td 
								%p Our Mission is “to make solar accessible to everyone by providing the best products, at the best prices, installed by the best team in the country.” We spend considerable time researching manufacturers of solar products to provide the best products for the best value. We strive to use our buying power to achieve the best prices so we can pass those on to our customers. Austin has some of the lowest prices in the country and we like to think we played a large role in getting there. Lastly, we employ the best team in the country. We constantly provide training to our new hires and to our most seasoned staff to assure our clients they are getting the best installation possible. We believe in the NABCEP certifications and support all of our team members as they work to achieve their own certifications. All of our Austin installers are OSHA 10 certified and we are fully insured with Auto, General Liability, and Worker’s Comprehensive insurance.
								
								%br

								%p Our Vision is “To see solar on every viable rooftop”. We work to achieve this by exceeding our customer’s expectations as can be seen by our reviews on solarreviews.com , Yelp.com , and Angieslist.com . Since 2009 we have installed over 925 properties that account for over 5 mW and have saved our customers over $1.25 million off of their electric bills. We would value the opportunity to help you make the move to solar.

						%tr
							%td.comment-icon Why Us
							%td 
								%p Native is an innovative green building company in the Central Texas region. We specialize in net zero construction, which means the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy created on site. We have in house photovoltaic (solar) services and install systems on residences and businesses all around Texas. Native is unique because we take a comprehensive approach when looking at a building and can address many aspects of making a home or business energy efficient as well as help reduce costs through solar. Native is not the least expensive PV installer, but you can ensure that the job will be done right and completed with integrity. We'll treat your project like we would a project on our own home. Native is a local family owned business, started in 2007. The tax credit may end in 2016, at which time Native will still be around to offer warranties and services for the PV products sold because of the diversification in our business model. Native stands strong in our mission to provide quality options for our customers that are as beneficial for them as they are for the environment and community.

							%td.comment-icon Why Us
							%td 
								%p Revolve Solar was founded in February 2012 and has quickly grown to be one of the top solar companies in the industry. Our founding team has been in the solar industry since 2006.  Our mission is to transform the world’s perception of renewable energy to create a better tomorrow through the mass adoption of renewable energy as a cleaner, less expensive energy source.
								
								%br

								%p Revolve Solar has been designated as a 2014 Angie’s List Super Service Award Winner.  We were also recently ranked by BuildZoom.com as No. 14 in the U.S. for Top Solar Contractors - 2014.

								%p Revolve uses the highest quality American made products with a 25 year performance warranties and 10 year workmanship guarantee on solar panels and inverters.

We truly believe that we are now in the age of a significant shift in power and the consumer now has more control than ever in history to choose how they power their homes.

We want to educate and empower our customers to make the best choice for themselves and the future of their family and the planet.
