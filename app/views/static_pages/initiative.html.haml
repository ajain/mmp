					%p We are organizing a group solar purchase program to help meet recent demand. The MMP helps reduce prices by streamlining the process between Homeowners, Solar Installers, the POA and Austin Energy. Additionally, MMP members focus on education to help prospective buyers determine if going solar is right for them. If you are interested in joining the over 225 homes in Mueller with solar, follow check out the "How It Works" section to learn about next steps.

					%td 1.
					%td.comment-icon Attend a MMP Happy Hour
					%td You'll learn everything you need to know about solar. We'll tell you what happens to solar panels when scenes from "Twister" unfold and walk you through how the technology works.
				%tr
					%td 2. 
					%td.roi-icon Figure out your ROI
					%td	Download this(COMING SOON) spreadsheet to determine your Return on Investment. Enter in your average monthly solar consumption on the 1st tab and the sheet will estimate your ROI. You can update the sheet with your pricing once you get bids to get a more accurate estimate.
				%tr 
					%td 3. 
					%td.search-icon Decide on 3 Solar Installers
					%td Check out the Participating Solar Installers page to learn about the 5 solar installers participating in Mueller Solar 2015. Read their information, check out their website, ask your friends, and pick 3 installers to get bids from. Email danx0601@yahoo.com your decision. Please include your (and if applicable your spouses) full name and email address.
				%tr
					%td 4. 
					%td.timer-icon Wait Patiently
					%td MMP will pass your contact information to the installers you selected. The installers will only contact you to let you know when they will be evaluating your roof. You do not need to be home for this. Once they do their evaluation, they will email you a proposal with a design & pricing. Yay!

				%tr 
					%td 5.
					%td.ok-icon Select a Proposal
					%td Once you receive all three proposals, you will need to select one. We highly recommend that you ask us questions - we will make ourselves available over beers (that you pay for) at HEB, Torchys and on the Street (not a new restaurant, just the actual street) 
				%tr
					%td 6.
					%td.write-icon Fill Out Paperwork
					%td At this point, you'll need to (a) sign a contract with the installer, (b) submit a Letter of Intent (LOI) to Austin Energy and (c) submit a request to the POA Modification Committee to approve your install.
				%tr 
					%td 7. 
					%td.sun-icon Go Solar!
					%td The solar installer you selected will schedule the installation of your system within a couple weeks. This process is pretty painless since they don't need access to the inside of your home. 


			/ %p OK!, fine, I'm 30.

							%td 
								%p Our Mission is “to make solar accessible to everyone by providing the best products, at the best prices, installed by the best team in the country.” We spend considerable time researching manufacturers of solar products to provide the best products for the best value. We strive to use our buying power to achieve the best prices so we can pass those on to our customers. Austin has some of the lowest prices in the country and we like to think we played a large role in getting there. Lastly, we employ the best team in the country. We constantly provide training to our new hires and to our most seasoned staff to assure our clients they are getting the best installation possible. We believe in the NABCEP certifications and support all of our team members as they work to achieve their own certifications. All of our Austin installers are OSHA 10 certified and we are fully insured with Auto, General Liability, and Worker’s Comprehensive insurance.
								
								%br

								%p Our Vision is “To see solar on every viable rooftop”. We work to achieve this by exceeding our customer’s expectations as can be seen by our reviews on solarreviews.com , Yelp.com , and Angieslist.com . Since 2009 we have installed over 925 properties that account for over 5 mW and have saved our customers over $1.25 million off of their electric bills. We would value the opportunity to help you make the move to solar.
